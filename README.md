## Hi there, I'm Leo ðŸ‘‹

I've been passionate about technology since childhood, influenced by the digital revolution of the 1990s. I've always been driven by curiosity and a desire to understand how things work â€” from science and history to economics and human behavior. I found in technology the perfect space to combine creativity, logic, and real-world impact. I hold a degree in Information Systems and have been working in the field for 15 years, building a career that started as an intern and progressed to an executive role as CTO, with strong experience in technical leadership and product development.

In recent years, I've deepened my focus on innovation and artificial intelligence. As a Technical Lead at [Asksuite](http://asksuite.com), I led the restructuring of the companyâ€™s main product using generative AI, designing a multi-agent architecture with autonomous agents built with Python, LangGraph, LangChain, and OpenAI. I worked on advanced solutions such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), prompt engineering and evaluation, and the creation of scalable, serverless applications on AWS.

Since 2022, I've been working as co-founder and fullstack developer at [Upar](http://upar.me), a startup focused on transforming people management. At Upar, I lead the development of our platform, with an emphasis on performance, scalability, and continuous innovation. Our mission is clear: to empower leaders to better guide and care for their teams, removing outdated processes and delivering real value.

I have solid experience with technologies such as Angular, Node.js, Java, NestJS, Python, PostgreSQL, AWS Cloud, Docker, OpenAI, LangChain; also experienced in development practices like OOP, Testing and CI/CD. Over my career, I have been actively involved in the development of several applications, from conception to production. I bring with me a genuine concern for code quality, maintainability and reusability. I also bring applied knowledge in areas such as performance evaluation, competency models, feedback, and people management â€” both as a foundation for product development and as a leadership practice throughout my career.
